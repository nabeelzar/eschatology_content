## What is Islamic Eschatalogy

Eschatology is commonly referred to beliefs related to the end of times. This site will primarily be looking at topics in relation to the end of times from the islamic paradigm, meaning the sources presented will be pulled from islam's two primary sources The holy Quran and Hadith.

## What is the Quran and Hadith

The Quran is the Word of God and contains complete guidance for mankind. Much of the Quran is about God, His attributes and man’s relationship to Him. It was revealed to Prophet Mohammad ﷺ and has remained unchanged since it's first revelation over 1400 years ago.

Hadith refer to the sayings or narrations of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ’s speech, his deeds, acts of approval & disapproval (verbal or by way of action) about something.

There are different grades of hadith demarcating their authenticity, we will use the islamic standard grading ruberic whenever presenting a hadith: Sahih (Strong/Sound), Hasan (Good), Da'if (Weak)
